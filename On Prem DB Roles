Oracle on-premises solutions, such as Oracle Database, do not have a built-in IAM (Identity and Access Management) system similar to cloud services like Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). However, Oracle provides solutions for on-premises IAM through its Oracle Identity and Access Management (IAM) Suite.

## Oracle Identity and Access Management (IAM) Suite for On-Premises:

1. Oracle Identity Manager (OIM):

   *  Oracle Identity Manager is a component of the Oracle IAM Suite that provides identity lifecycle management. It helps organizations manage user identities and their access privileges.
  
2. Oracle Access Manager (OAM):
   *  Oracle Access Manager provides access management and single sign-on functionality. It enables organizations to control access to applications and resources based on user roles and policies.

3. Oracle Internet Directory (OID):
   *  Oracle Internet Directory is a directory service that stores and manages identity-related information. It is often used as the LDAP directory for Oracle IAM solutions.

4.  Oracle Virtual Directory (OVD):
  *  Oracle Virtual Directory is a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) service that provides a virtual view of identity data from multiple sources, helping to integrate and centralize identity information.

 ## Basic Steps for On-Premises IAM Role Setup:
    1. Installation and Configuration:
        * Install and configure the Oracle Identity and Access Management Suite components (OIM, OAM, OID, OVD) on your on-premises infrastructure.

  2.   Define Roles and Policies:
      *  Within Oracle Identity Manager, define roles that represent specific job functions or responsibilities.
      *  Associate users with these roles based on their responsibilities.

  3.  Set Access Policies:
      *  Use Oracle Access Manager to set up access policies that determine which resources (applications, databases, etc.) users with specific roles can access.

  4.  LDAP Integration:
     *  Integrate Oracle Internet Directory with Oracle Identity Manager to store and manage identity-related information centrally.

  5.  Single Sign-On (SSO):
    *   Implement single sign-on capabilities using Oracle Access Manager to allow users to authenticate once and access multiple resources seamlessly.

  6.  Monitoring and Auditing:
    *   Set up monitoring and auditing features to track user activities and ensure compliance with security policies.

## Example Role Assignment:
      For example, within Oracle Identity Manager, you might create a role called "Database Administrator" and associate it with users who need administrative access to Oracle databases. The access policies within Oracle Access Manager would then control what actions those users can perform on the databases.

      Remember that the specifics of role creation, policy definition, and integration may vary based on the versions of Oracle IAM Suite components you are using. Always refer to the official documentation for the version you have installed for detailed instructions.
